# NimbusNest Inventory Turnover Case Study

This is a realistic data analysis case study created to demonstrate how I approach inventory optimization challenges using **Excel**, **SQL**, **R**, and visual storytelling for stakeholders. It is based on a fictional e-commerce brand, NimbusNest, which specializes in minimalist home organization products.

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to:
- Clean and analyze messy inventory data from Q1 2025
- Identify high vs. low-turnover products by category and warehouse
- Visualize performance insights
- Provide actionable business recommendations
- Showcase multiple tools and formats (Excel, SQL, R, PowerPoint, PDF)
